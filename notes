passport is node js library helps us add authentication
it comes with strategies (techniques) we will use local strategy
facebook uses oauth that allow user to enter a application using their account




initially i used vendor's ad id though i called it 
but now i decided to use pair of vendor user and other user and vendor can't create a room directly


i have already set up login routes using passport.authenticate method

now i want to prevent unwanted access and i see password provide isAuthenticate method that has been added to req in a session

we will combine it with a middleware in order to serve many routes 


whenever vendor type reply its going to standard user router and it is not available for vendor
